## Testing Next.js v13

One one the reason why I built Repurpose Tweet is to test some new Next 13 features such as
* app dir
* metadata
* Route handler

There is a problem and I made an issue 😄

[Throws `Illegal invocation` when I called the edge route handler from the client · Issue #46337 · vercel/next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/46337)

I am using pages/api for APIs for now, so the app works fine on [repurpose-tweet.vercel.app](https://repurpose-tweet.vercel.app/) 👍
